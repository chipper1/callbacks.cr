An expressive callbacks module for [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  callbacks:
    github: vladfaust/callbacks.cr
    version: ~> 0.1.1
```

This shard follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/), so see [releases](https://github.com/vladfaust/callbacks.cr/releases) and change the `version` accordingly.

## Usage

```crystal
require "callbacks"

class Foo
  include Callbacks

  def call
    with_callbacks { puts "call" }
  end

  before do
    puts "1"; true # Must return truthy value for the callchain to proceed
  end

  before do
    puts "2"; true
  end

  around do
    puts "3"
    yield
    puts "4"
  end

  after do
    puts "5"
  end

  after do
    puts "6" # Will not be called because previous after callback returned falsey value
  end
end

Foo.new.call
# 1, 2, 3, call, 4, 5
```

Objects including `Callbacks` module can also be inherited preserving all callbacks:

```crystal
class Bar < Foo
  # Childrens before callbacks have higher precedence
  before do
    puts "7"; true
  end

  # Childrens around callbacks are higher in the stack
  around do
    puts "8"
    yield
    puts "9"
  end

  # Childrens after callbacks executed after parents'
  after do
    puts "10" # Will not be called as well because Foo's arounds stop at 5
  end
end

Bar.new.call
# 7, 1, 2, 8, 3, call, 4, 9, 5
```
